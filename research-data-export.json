Thanks for sharing your insights. \n\nHere's a quick summary of what I heard from you:\n- Your change in belief was gradual as you consumed more media.\n- You found that the information made more sense to you over time.\n- A key takeaway for you is the belief that “the elites are lying to us.”\n- You feel less concerned about climate change now, viewing it as a “hectic hoax.”\n\nDoes that sound right? Did I miss anything important?",
