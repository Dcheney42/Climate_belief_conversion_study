                    <p>Thank you for your interest in participating in this research project. Please read the following information about the project so that you can decide whether you would like to take part in this research. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have about your involvement in the project. You can also talk to someone you trust, like a family member or friend.</p>
                    
                    <p>Participation in this research is voluntary. If you do not wish to take part, you do not have to. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to stop at any time, and you would not need to give any explanation for your decision to stop participating.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you decide to take part, you will be asked to sign a Consent Form and will be given a copy of that signed form and this Participant Information Sheet to keep. Your decision whether you take part, or not to take part, or to take part and then withdraw, will not affect your relationship with The University of Queensland.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What is the purpose of this research?</h2>
                    <p>This research aims to investigate people's self-reported narratives about why they changed their minds about topics of science. This study is being conducted by researchers at the University of Queensland Business School.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What does participation involve?</h2>
                    <p>If you agree to participate, you will be asked to: (a) complete a brief survey about your views on topics of science and (b) engage in a 10-minute (maximum) conversation with an AI chatbot. The total time commitment is approximately 10-15 minutes. All participation will be online through the Prolific platform and our survey website.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h2>
                    <p>While there may be no direct benefits to you, your participation will contribute to our understanding of people's attitudes towards topics relating to technology and science.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What are the possible risks and disadvantages of taking part?</h2>
                    <p>The risks associated with this study are minimal. You may experience mild discomfort when discussing how your views on topics of science shifted while conversing with the chatbot.</p>
