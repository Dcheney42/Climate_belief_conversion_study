The change happened gradually over several years as I learned more about the science. Well, I started reading more scientific studies and reports. There were a few key things - seeing the temperature data trends, learning about ice core evidence, and understanding how carbon dioxide actually works as a greenhouse gas. I also watched some documentaries that explained the consensus among climate scientists. It was actually quite gradual and sometimes uncomfortable. I remember feeling resistant at first because I had to admit I was wrong about something I felt pretty confident about. But as I learned more about the scientific method and saw how consistent the evidence was, it became harder to deny. The turning point was probably understanding that scientific consensus isn't just opinion - it's based on rigorous research and peer review. I think what mattered most was being willing to question my assumptions and really look at the evidence with an open mind. Now I see climate change as one of the most serious challenges we face, whereas before I thought it was either natural or overblown. I also have much more respect for the scientific process and peer review. I realize I used to dismiss things too quickly without really understanding them. The emotional aspect was also important - I had to get past feeling defensive about being wrong. I think I'm more curious now and less dogmatic about issues I haven't fully researched.",
