340,178,"That makes sense. It seems like your distrust of your teacher extended to scientists as a whole, which has influenced your beliefs about climate change.

• An advertisement in a magazine suggested that climate change was fake, which caught your attention.

212,622,"I see! So, you were primarily consuming right-wing news. How did that perspective change for you over time? Was there a particular moment or piece of information that made you start questioning the views you had?",e9cddf33-3c34-4057-b8ff-4dc2b4702235,edededed,chatbot,2025-09-01T04:43:11.783Z

255,624,"That makes sense! It sounds like as you consumed more media, your understanding evolved gradually. Can you tell me a bit more about what that shift was like for you? Was it a gradual realization, or were there specific moments that really clicked for you?",e9cddf33-3c34-4057-b8ff-4dc2b4702235,edededed,chatbot,2025-09-01T04:43:11.783Z

286,628,That's a significant point. It seems like a distrust in authority and the feeling that information might be manipulated played a role in your belief change. How do you see your views today compared to before your change? Do you feel more empowered or concerned about climate change now?,e9cddf33-3c34-4057-b8ff-4dc2b4702235,edededed,chatbot,2025-09-01T04:43:11.783Z

591,630,"I appreciate your honesty. So, it sounds like your perspective has shifted not just to believing in climate change, but also questioning the motivations behind it. Thanks for sharing your insights. 

Here's a quick summary of what I heard from you:
- Your change in belief was gradual as you consumed more media.
- You found that the information made more sense to you over time.
- A key takeaway for you is the belief that “the elites are lying to us.”
- You feel less concerned about climate change now, viewing it as a “hectic hoax.”

Does that sound right? Did I miss anything important?",e9cddf33-3c34-4057-b8ff-4dc2b4702235,edededed,chatbot,2025-09-01T04:43:11.783Z
