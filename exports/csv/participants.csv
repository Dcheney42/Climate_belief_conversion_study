,"Thank you for sharing your experience! Here's what I heard from you:

• You used to think climate change was mostly natural, but now believe it's mainly caused by human activities.
• The change happened gradually over several years as you learned more about the science.
• You started reading scientific studies and reports, which influenced your perspective.
• Key things included seeing temperature data trends and learning about ice core evidence.
• Understanding how carbon dioxide works as a greenhouse gas was important.
• You watched documentaries that explained the consensus among climate scientists.
• Your views shifted gradually and sometimes felt uncomfortable.
• You felt resistant initially because you had to admit you were wrong about something you were confident in.
• Learning about the scientific method helped you see the consistency of the evidence.",,believer,"I used to think climate change was mostly natural, but now I believe it's mainly caused by human activities. The change happened gradually over several years as I learned more about the science. Well, I started reading more scientific studies and reports. There were a few key things - seeing the temperature data trends, learning about ice core evidence, and understanding how carbon dioxide actually works as a greenhouse gas. I also watched some documentaries that explained the consensus among climate scientists. It was actually quite gradual and sometimes uncomfortable. I remember feeling resistant at first because I had to admit I was wrong about something I felt pretty confident about. But as I learned more about the scientific method and saw how consistent the evidence was, it became harder to deny. The turning point was probably understanding that scientific consensus isn't just opinion - it's based on rigorous research and peer review. I think what mattered most was being willing to question my assumptions and really look at the evidence with an open mind. Now I see climate change as one of the most serious challenges we face, whereas before I thought it was either natural or overblown. I also have much more respect for the scientific process and peer review. I realize I used to dismiss things too quickly without really understanding them. The emotional aspect was also important - I had to get past feeling defensive about being wrong. I think I'm more curious now and less dogmatic about issues I haven't fully researched.",true,true,,,,false,3678e7e7-dee8-4599-92fc-19e4191781e4,,,TEST67890,,2025-08-29T06:08:53.605Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But one day, he showed me his data collection So, he showed me data that siad the climate cycles were all random and there was nothing to worry about Yeah I think I used to really feel that I could trust scientists but now I just don't think so anymore.

,"Got it! It seems like consuming more conservative media has played a significant role in your perspective shift. Thanks for sharing that insight. 

Here's a quick summary of what I heard from you:
- Your shift in beliefs was gradual rather than sudden.
- A key factor in your change was stopping the consumption of liberal media.
- Listening to more conservative media, like Bill O'Reilly, influenced your views on climate change.

Does that sound right? Did I miss anything important?",,skeptic,"I used to think it was all legit but now I think it' More of a gradual change. I just stopped listening to liberal media.

- Your change in belief was gradual as you consumed more media.
- You found that the information made more sense to you over time.
