11,sess_05b57d07,assistant,That's a significant point. It seems like a distrust in authority and the feeling that information might be manipulated played a role in your belief change.

13,sess_05b57d07,assistant,"I appreciate your honesty. So, it sounds like your perspective has shifted not just to believing in climate change, but also questioning the motivations behind it. Thanks for sharing your insights. 

Here's a quick summary of what I heard from you:
- Your change in belief was gradual as you consumed more media.
- You found that the information made more sense to you over time.
- A key takeaway for you is the belief that “the elites are lying to us.”
- You feel less concerned about climate change now, viewing it as a “hectic hoax.”

Does that sound right? Did I miss anything important?",591,2025-09-01T04:43:11.783Z,2025-09-01T04:43:11.783Z

75,sess_3aa97565,assistant,"Hi there! Thanks for continuing with the study. Earlier, you mentioned that your view on climate change shifted — from believer to skeptic. I'd love to hear more about that. Can you tell me in your own words how that change came about?",235,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z

77,sess_3aa97565,assistant,That's interesting! Can you tell me a bit more about what you read in the magazine that influenced your views? Were there specific articles or arguments that stood out to you?,175,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z

79,sess_3aa97565,assistant,I see. So that advertisement caught your attention. Can you share more about what it said that made you rethink your beliefs? Did it lead you to explore other sources or ideas?,176,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z
80,sess_3aa97565,529c7c11-ea77-4829-96fe-8a76d91ba428,Yeah it made me think about how it's always these big wig scientists that tell me it's real and I really hate them,114,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z
81,sess_3aa97565,assistant,It sounds like that advertisement sparked some strong feelings for you. Can you elaborate on why you feel that way about the scientists? Was there a particular experience or reason that made you distrust them?,209,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z
82,sess_3aa97565,529c7c11-ea77-4829-96fe-8a76d91ba428,I hated my high school science teacher,38,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z
83,sess_3aa97565,assistant,That’s an important insight. It seems like your past experiences with your science teacher might have influenced how you view scientists in general. Can you share more about your experiences in high school that led to those feelings? How do you think that relates to your current beliefs about climate change?,309,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z
84,sess_3aa97565,529c7c11-ea77-4829-96fe-8a76d91ba428,Yeah was such a tool,20,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z
85,sess_3aa97565,assistant,I understand. It sounds like your teacher's approach really impacted your feelings toward science and perhaps even the people in that field. How do you think those feelings towards your teacher shaped your viewpoint on climate change and the scientists who study it?,266,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z

87,sess_3aa97565,assistant,"That makes sense. It seems like your distrust of your teacher extended to scientists as a whole, which has influenced your beliefs about climate change. Looking back, was there a particular moment or experience, apart from the magazine ad and your teacher, that solidified your shift towards skepticism? Or was it more of a gradual process?",340,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z

89,sess_3aa97565,assistant,"Got it. So it sounds like there was a moment of clarity for you where everything clicked into place, and you felt certain about your skepticism. Looking back, what stands out as most important in shaping the way you see climate change now? Are there any other influences or experiences you think contributed to that shift?",322,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z

91,sess_3aa97565,assistant,"That's completely fine. It's really valuable to hear your perspective. So, just to recap what you've shared so far:

• An advertisement in a magazine suggested that climate change was fake, which caught your attention.
• You felt strong distrust towards scientists, mainly influenced by your negative experience with your high school science teacher.
• This distrust contributed to your overall skepticism about climate change.
• There was a moment where everything came together for you, leading to your firm belief that climate change is not real.

Does that sound right? Did I miss anything important?",604,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z,2025-09-01T23:57:16.010Z
